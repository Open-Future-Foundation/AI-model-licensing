# License categories

For the purpose of our analysis we have categorized the licenses present in the datasets obtained from huggingface.ai into six different categories: 

* **Permissive / BY** (permissive open source software licenses and attribution-style open content and open data licenses)
* **Copyleft / SA** (Copyleft software licenses and Share Alike style open content and open data licenses)
* **Public Domain** (Public Domain dedications and licenses that come with no restrictions or conditions)
* **Open RAIL** (Licenses from the Open RAIL family of licenses including the original RAIL license)
* **Non-commercial use only** (software, content and data licenses that do not allow commercial use)
* **Other restrictions** (licenses that come with other restrictions, for example prohibitions on creating derivatives)

In addition to these there are three categories called `other`, `unknown` and `non categorizable` which we have excluded from further analytical steps because they do not add to developing our analysis. The first two include the repositories that have those as license information, as explained in the methodological note. The latter includes the repositories with licenses `cc` and `odbl` which spanned different categories of licenses. 
The categorization has relied on the analysis of the main provisions of the licenses and — for open source software licenses — has been cross referenced with the categorisation presented as part of the [comparison of free and open-source software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses) available on wikipedia.org 

The catgorisation of all licenses encoutered in the data obtained from huggingface can be found at [licenses.csv](https://github.com/Open-Future-Foundation/AI-model-licensing/blob/main/licenses.csv)
