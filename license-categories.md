# License categories

For the purpose of our anallysis we have categorized the licenses persent in the snapshots obtained from huggingface.ai into five different categories: 

* **Permissive / BY** (permissive open source software licenses and attribution-style open content and open data licenses)
* **Copyleft / SA** (Copyleft software licenses and Share Alike style open content and open data licenses)
* **Public Domain** (Public Domain dedications and licenses that come with no restrictions or conditions)
* **Open RAIL** (Licenses from the Open RAIL family of licenses including the original RAIL license)
* **Non-commercial use only** (software, content and data licenses that do not allow commercial use)
* **Other restrictions** (licenses that come with other restrictions, for example prohibitions on creating derivatives)

In addition there are three categories `Other`, `unknown` and `non categorizable` which we have excluded from further analytical steps because they do not add to developing our analysis. 
The categorization has relied on the analysis of the main provisions of the licenses and — for open source software licenses has been cross referenced with the categorisation presented as part of the [comparison of free and open-source software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses) available on wikipedia.org 

The catgorisation of all licenses encoutered in the data obtained from huggingface can be found at [licenses.csv](https://github.com/Open-Future-Foundation/AI-model-licensing/blob/main/licenses.csv)
